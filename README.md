# Runner-A-
This program generate routes for runners and cyclists based on their needs. First, it takes in an user-specified starting location, and generate possible routes for running or biking based on the user's specification (i.e. elevation gain, safety of routes, distance of routes.)  The project consists of two modules: geographical representation using open source APIs and path finding using A* algorithm, but it still remains a prototype at this stage. However, we have discovered that our program are flexible enough so that it can be tailored to the needs of the user since we can design the heuristic functions and movement cost functions based on the optimization needs of the user. In this proof-of-concept design, we hypothesized a heuristic functions describing the crime rates of the node and a movement cost describing the elevation gain.
